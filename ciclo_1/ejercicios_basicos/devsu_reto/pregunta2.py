#2. Maximum element with the maximum sum
#
#Let numbers be an array of integers. Get the maximum element in the array that produces the largest sum when adding all the elements that are different from itself.
#
#Example 1
#
#Input:
#
#numbers = [1,1,2,3,4,5,5,5,6]
#
#Output: 2
#
#Explanation:
#
#For 1, the sum of the rest of elements different from itself is 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 6 = 30.
#For 2, the sum is 30.
#For 3, the sum is 29.
#For 4, the sum is 28.
#For 5, the sum is 17.
#For 6, the sum is 26.
#Both 1 and 2 produce the greatest sum (30), but 2 is greater than 1. Therefore, 2 is the maximum element that produces the largest sum.
#
#Also, consider that the numbers can be positive or negative.
